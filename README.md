# JavaScript bind()

## Objectives

1. Explain how to use `Function.prototype.bind()`
2. Describe use cases for `bind()`
3. Describe pitfalls of using `bind()`

## Overview

There's a section on `bind()` in [this lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/javascript-this-code-along)

We can build on this; there are some interesting tests in [this lab](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/javascript-fix-this).

Are there still memory concerns with `bind()`? I've done a tiny bit of
profiling, and I can't seem to see major issues anymore â€” but it might be worth
investigating.
